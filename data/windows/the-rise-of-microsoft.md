## The Rise of Microsoft

**This piece offers a concise history of Microsoft: what conditions the company was born into, how the company got its start, its foray into operating systems beginning with Unix, and the rise of MS-DOS through which came Windows as we know it today.**

The Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) was a programming language created by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth College in 1964. It was a high-level language designed for its ease of use especially by computer novices and people in non-scientific fields. These characteristics of BASIC contributed to its popularity, leading to numerous major implementations across a wide range of platforms.

First created in 1969, UNIX was developed at Bell Laboratories, which at the time was part of the Bell System (1877-1984) and operated as the research and development arm within AT&T. The Bell System had been under antitrust scrutiny by US regulators ever since the 1910s and one of its effects was the [1956 Consent Decree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System#1956_Consent_Decree). This legal agreement [restricted members of the Bell System from manufacturing and selling computer products](https://memorial.bellsystem.com/decisiontodivest.html#:~:text=Under%20the%201956%20consent%20decree%2C%20however%2C%20these%20computer%20products%20could%20not%20be%20manufactured%20and%20sold%20by%20the%20Bell%20System.) and [required them to license their technology to all applicants in exchange for the payment of reasonable royalties](https://memorial.bellsystem.com/decisiontodivest.html#:~:text=AT%26T%2C%20Western%20Electric%2C%20and%20Bell%20Laboratories%20were%20required%20to%20license%20their%20patents%20to%20all%20applicants%2Dboth%20domestic%20and%20foreign%2Dupon%20the%20payment%20of%20reasonable%20royalties.). The original UNIX versions from version zero through to the Fourth Edition were only ever shared within Bell Labs due to the system still being under heavy development. UNIX Fifth Edition was the first version of UNIX distributed outside of Bell Labs. AT&T provided the operating system to select recipients for [use, development, and sale free of charge](https://unix.org/what_is_unix/history_timeline.html#:~:text=recipients%20of%20the%20(at%20that%20time%20free)%20UNIX%20system%20code%20all%20began%20developing%20their%20own%20different%20versions%20in%20their%20own%2C%20different%2C%20ways%20for%20use%20and%20sale). [UNIX Sixth Edition became the first widely distributed version](https://gunkies.org/wiki/UNIX_Sixth_Edition) with a cost of around [$20,000 for a commercial license or $200 for a educational license](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1983-10/page/n133/mode/1up). The high commercial price reflected the even higher price of hardware that could run UNIX, the cost of research and development that went into UNIX, the commercial success AT&T was already seeing of UNIX derivatives, and the market conditions of UNIX being the state-of-the-art system with no real competitors. The low cost of educational licenses enforced the popularity of UNIX in research and academia thereby supporting its development. [In 1973](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1983-08/page/n189/mode/1up), UNIX Fourth Edition became the first operating system written not in assembly but in the C programming language—another Bell Labs creation (the [transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor) was invented there as well). This shift made UNIX portable to any processor that had a C compiler written for it, once the system was adapted to the processor's unique interfaces. UNIX was an advanced operating system (OS) with features like security, multitasking, a hierarchical file system, and true processes with independent memory spaces that required the hardware have a memory management unit (MMU).

Debuting in 1974, CP/M was an operating system built to accommodate the modest hardware of early microcomputers. CP/M, invented by Digital Research founder & CEO Gary Kildall, introduced the concept of a Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) that isolated keyboard, screen, disk, and other device I/O from the rest of the operating system thus enabling applications to run independently of the underlying hardware on any system implementing the same BIOS interface; was known for its lightweight and efficient footprint; and was designed with an open philosophy whereby all of its interfaces, internal and external, were well-documented in the programming interface reference of the CP/M manual. The system exhibited a high degree of excellence in engineering. By the late 1970s, [CP/M had become the de facto standard operating system for microcomputers](https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/02/cpm_50th_anniversary/).

In 1975, Microsoft then stylized as "Micro-Soft", was born. The company's first product was Microsoft BASIC, an implementation of the BASIC programming language. Developed by Microsoft founders Paul Allen and Bill Gates, Microsoft BASIC targeted the [the popular Altair 8800 home computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Popular_Electronics_Cover_Jan_1975.jpg), the first commercially successful personal computer. Following contact and a successful demo of the product to Altair manufacturer Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), Microsoft secured a licensing deal for what would be rebranded to Altair BASIC. The success of the Altair 8800 in North America led to the proportional success of Microsoft BASIC, causing Microsoft's implementation of BASIC to become the [de facto standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto_standard) for home computers in that region. The start of a lucrative licensing business for Microsoft, the company licensed its BASIC implementation to many companies, including Apple, for the creation of AppleSoft BASIC.

[In 1978](https://archive.org/details/unixinternalspra0000pate/page/9/mode/1up), Microsoft purchased a license from AT&T, a Bell System member, for [Version 7 Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_7_Unix) with the goal of porting it to [microcomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer#Colloquial_use_of_the_term) (since Unix was originally developed for larger [minicomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicomputer) like the PDP-7 and PDP-11). This is back when [Microsoft was shipping a Unix-based operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix#History) and believed Unix to be the ["future desktop operating system, when machines got powerful enough to run something good"](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.os.ms-windows.misc/c/-iNeep60eVE/m/Xl5ddAtJENcJ). Xenix, Microsoft's entry into the operating system market and the [first microcomputer adaptation of Unix](https://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/comphist/comp1980.htm), was a huge success. [By the mid-1980s](https://books.google.ca/books?id=UE1HODexHKoC&pg=PA44), Xenix had become "the most widely installed Unix-based microcomputer operating system", and since microcomputers were taking over in this time period and throughout the [end of the 1980s](https://archive.org/details/designimplementa0000unse/page/7/mode/1up), it likely became the most popular Unix distribution overall.

In April 1980, Microsoft released their first hardware product, the [Z-80 SoftCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-80_SoftCard). The Z-80 SoftCard was a plug-in processor card for the Apple II that enabled it to run the CP/M operating system. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen came up with the idea. However, Microsoft was not skilled in creating hardware. So, the technical work of designing the card was outsourced first to Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) then to contractor Don Burtis of Burtronix. When the card came to market it was a hit, allowing users to combine widespread Apple II hardware with the widespread CP/M operating system. Rebranded to the Microsoft SoftCard due to its popularity, the product made up Microsoft's largest individual revenue source in 1980.

[In the second half of 1980](https://archive.org/details/Big_Blues_The_Unmaking_IBM_Paul_Carroll/page/18/mode/1up), IBM ("Big Blue", the most dominant tech company at the time) was in need of an operating system for their upcoming IBM PC. IBM had become aware of Microsoft for their work in creating Microsoft BASIC and previously had a meeting with them about licensing this programming language for usage in [their portable computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5100). [After failing to strike a deal with Gary Kindall of Digital Research for adapting the CP/M operating system to the IBM PC](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/13/obituaries/gary-kildall-52-crucial-player-in-computer-development-dies.html#:~:text=Mr.%20Kildall%20has%20said%20that%20in%20fact%20he%20attended%20the%20meeting%20and%20left%20believing%20that%20he%20had%20struck%20a%20deal%20with%20I.B.M.), IBM met with Microsoft to explore if they had an operating system to offer. Bill Gates' mother, Mary Gates, was a chair in the executive committee of United Way, [the then largest non-profit organization in the United States by donations from the public](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2017/03/23/a-philanthropic-boom-donor-advised-funds#:~:text=Last%20year%20Fidelity%20Charitable%20overtook%20United%20Way%2C%20a%20traditional%20non%2Dprofit%20organisation%2C%20to%20become%20America%E2%80%99s%20biggest%20charity%20by%20donations%20from%20the%20public%20(see%20chart).), where she served alongside other committee members including the [then IBM president and soon-to-be CEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Opel), John Opel. [Mary Gates discussed with John Opel the business IBM was doing with her son's business](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/11/obituaries/mary-gates-64-helped-her-son-start-microsoft.html#:~:text=Her%20tenure%20on%20the%20national%20board%27s%20executive%20committee%20is%20believed%20to%20have%20helped%20Microsoft%2C%20based%20in%20Seattle%2C%20at%20a%20crucial%20time.)—by some accounts, Mr. Opel mentioned Mrs. Gates to other IBM executives and then a few weeks later, IBM hired Microsoft to provide an operating system for the IBM PC—this professional connection which Bill Gates held through his family helped influence IBM to approach Microsoft after negotiations with Digital Research fell through. Microsoft did not have an operating system for the IBM PC (Xenix was unsuitable because of the hardware limitations of the IBM PC), but promised to deliver one. [Bill Gates rushed to purchase 86-DOS](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/13/obituaries/gary-kildall-52-crucial-player-in-computer-development-dies.html#:~:text=Mr.%20Gates%2C%20who%20at%20the%20time%20did%20not%20sell%20an%20operating%20system%2C%20rushed%20to%20buy%20one%20from%20a%20small%20Seattle%20company.) by Tim Paterson for $75,000 dollars in total (initially $25,000 for a non-exclusive license, later followed by another $50,000 for an exclusive license) from Seattle Computer Products. 86-DOS, originally known as the Quick and Dirty Operating system (QDOS), was a rewrite of CP/M from 8080 assembly to 8086 assembly for the Intel 8086 processor and [reimplemented the openly specified CP/M interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Kildall#Computer_Connections). Gary Kildall could have sued over this copying due to patent infringement [with a good chance of winning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_litigation#GEM_%22look_and_feel%22_suit), especially because what was able to be protected about software throughout this time under United States law was not yet solidified: however, Mr. Kildall decided not to sue because ["in those days everyone was imitating everyone else"](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/13/obituaries/gary-kildall-52-crucial-player-in-computer-development-dies.html#:~:text=In%20those%20days%20everyone%20was%20imitating%20everyone%20else) anyway, and he disliked the the cut-throat aspects of business. Digital Research did complete their port of CP/M from the Intel 8080 (an 8-bit microprocessor) the Intel 8086 (a 16-bit microprocessor) in late 1981, calling it [CP/M-86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M-86), but by then the IBM and Microsoft deal was done. This port took a while for Digital Research to complete because they focused on delivering a high-quality and stable system, whereas QDOS was expediently thrown together as quickly as possible. Further, when CP/M-86 did come out and IBM eventually offered it as an option to consumers with the IBM PC, [IBM sold the computer with Digital Research's operating system for an added fee of $240 compared to only an extra $40 for the computer with Microsoft's operating system](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/13/obituaries/gary-kildall-52-crucial-player-in-computer-development-dies.html#:~:text=Eventually%20I.B.M.%20offered%20both%20Digital%20Research%27s%20CP/M%2D16%20and%20Microsoft%27s%20MS%2DDOS%20operating%20systems%20with%20the%20I.B.M.%20PC.%20But%20it%20priced%20its%20version%20of%20the%20Microsoft%20operating%20system%2C%20PC%2DDOS%2C%20at%20%2440%20and%20the%20Digital%20Resarch%20operating%20system%20at%20%24240.). The [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer) and [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) renamed by Microsoft from 86-DOS, which IBM rebranded to PC-DOS for use on their hardware, released on the same day of August 12, 1981.

[Within about a year](https://books.google.ca/books?id=VDAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22) after MS-DOS launching on the IBM PC, Microsoft had already licensed over 70 copies of their operating system to other companies for use on their computers. It was easy for third-party computer manufacturers to create IBM PC clones because IBM built the IBM PC using off-the-shelf hardware components. The combination of MS-DOS debuting to such a large audience on the IBM PC in combination with the easily cloneable nature of the IBM PC gave Microsoft a monumental business opportunity and they were capitalizing on it. Microsoft's business strategy of licensing their operating system to computer manufacturers instead of making their own line of computers and selling them with MS-DOS was unique for the time: it allowed MS-DOS to spread quickly using established computer manufacturing companies and their distribution networks. [IBM's BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) provided support for keyboard, video, and disk devices: it standardized an interface for how applications or an operating system can interact with these devices and how hardware can communicate with the operating system. The idea of a BIOS originated from CP/M, however, IBM's BIOS was unique for a few reasons: it set a standard protocol for devices to communicate in; IBM's BIOS implementation created its own API for application-device interaction instead of reusing the definitions set by the CP/M BIOS; and the implementation was proprietary. To capitalize on the popularity of the IBM PC, various computer manufacturers reverse engineered IBM's BIOS to create their own [IBM PC compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible) hardware and IBM PC clones. As a result, IBM's BIOS implementation became the de facto standard. The manufacturers that pre-loaded their systems with MS-DOS wrote drivers to support their other hardware products such as mice—until Microsoft released the [Microsoft Mouse in 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Mouse) with their own driver then its interface became the de facto standard—and printers, which were distributed with the purchased hardware on a floppy disk. Since MS-DOS came with its [DOS API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_API) which was primarily a reimplementation of CP/M's Basic Disk Operating System (BDOS) API, a number of applications already existed for the operating system. Put together, these factors made computers pre-loaded with MS-DOS broadly accessible and favorable to consumers.

[On January 8, 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System), a settlement was reached to break up the Bell System due to its monopoly power (telecommunication companies were the Big Tech of their era). Following the split, AT&T was freed from the 1956 Consent Decree as part of the settlement and continued to develop System V under its newly restructured [AT&T Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Technologies) division. No longer bound by the 1956 Consent Decree, AT&T was free to sell Unix, releasing [UNIX System V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_V) in 1983 as its flagship commercial Unix operating system. AT&T was now selling Unix in competition to Microsoft and since AT&T had the original Unix developers working for them, they were well-positioned to define the standard interfaces for Unix operating systems: this was the [System V Interface Definition (SVID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_V_Interface_Definition). [Bill Gates immediately interpreted this move by AT&T as being about control of Unix](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.os.ms-windows.misc/c/-iNeep60eVE/m/Xl5ddAtJENcJ#:~:text=Bill%20Gates%20knew%2C%20right%20away%2C%20that%20there%20was%20no%0Astrong%20future%20in%20Unix%20for%20us%20any%20more.) thus convincing him to abandon the operating system and concentrate on Microsoft's own closely controlled offerings. Microsoft quickly began work on a new operating system, what would later become known as OS/2. Although, writing an operating system from scratch, particularly the advanced kind with capabilities matching what Unix had, is a huge task and there was a significant time horizon before it would be in any workable state. So, for the foreseeable future, Microsoft would still be a Unix vendor. [In 1984](https://unix.org/what_is_unix/history_timeline.html#:~:text=A%20group%20of%20vendors%20concerned%20about%20the%20continuing%20encroachment%20into%20their%20markets%20and%20control%20of%20system%20interfaces%20by%20the%20larger%20companies), other Unix vendors also began to publicly voice their concerns about AT&T's leverage over the Unix ecosystem. However, these vendors responded by banding together to promote "open systems", shifting control away from AT&T by defining shared specifications and standards. This concept resulted in the creation of X/Open Company Ltd in 1987, today known as The Open Group, a consortium for making vendor-neutral Unix standards. AT&T was ultimately cooperative with standardization efforts and helped to unify Unix rather than control it: AT&T and many other companies collectively joined X/Open; SVID Fourth Edition adopted [X/Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X/Open); [AT&T partnered with Sun Microsystems](https://unix.org/what_is_unix/history_timeline.html#:~:text=In%20a%20move%20intended%20to%20unify%20the%20market%20in%201987%2C%20AT%26T%20announced%20a%20pact%20with%20Sun%20Microsystems), the largest Unix vendor after Microsoft exited the Unix market, to help unify Unix; and in [late 1989](https://www.techmonitor.ai/technology/att_releases_unix_system_v4_with_reduced_licence_fee#:~:text=And%20in%20order%20to%20encourage%20vendors%20to%20offer%20products%20compliant%20with%20X/Open%20Group%20Ltd%20guidelines%2C%20a%20standard%20sublicensing%20option%20is%20offered%20under%20which%20vendors%20are%20elegible%20for%20reduced%20fees), AT&T offered reduced licensing fees for vendors that adopted the X/Open standards in their Unix distribution. [By 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_Laboratories,_Inc._v._Berkeley_Software_Design,_Inc.#Settlement), what started as a patch set for adding useful features to Unix by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at University of California, Berkley, would transform into a complete and legally ratified rewrite of Unix under a permissive open source license thereby replacing the need for AT&T's proprietary code.

A common myth surrounding Microsoft continuing to base their flagship operating system on Unix after its transformation into System V is that is would have been untenable due to AT&T's high licensing fees: In fact, the per-system cost for sublicensing a Unix derivative such as Xenix was [only $60 for a 1-2 user system](http://web.archive.org/web/20241003115946/https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/licenses/pricelist84.pdf)—that is only $30 per-seat—and a $25,000 up-front fee to start as a Unix sublicensing business. Plus, a bulk discount of 2% for each $100,000 of sales commitment up to an advertised maximum discount of $3 million dollars or 60%. Indeed, AT&T's licensing of System V was so lax that Microsoft made a ["big business"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K3eMzF6x28&t=59s) off the back of Unix by exploiting the favorable licensing terms set by AT&T to buy Unix licenses in bulk then re-sell them at a price that undercut the business responsible for developing Unix. Source licenses for AT&T's top-of-the-line operating system needed for developer [workstations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstation#Origins_and_development) were more expensive at a $43,000 ([or later more](https://www.techmonitor.ai/technology/att_releases_unix_system_v4_with_reduced_licence_fee)) up-front cost for a commercial license then $16,000 per additional system (the cited price list states "per additional CPU" but this measurement only served as a concrete unit for one system because multi-core processors did not exist at the time). The cost of these source licenses was negligible for a few key reasons: the source license fees did not affect sublicensors' ability to economically scale their Unix sales; the workstation computers businesses installed Unix on were typically more expensive than the Unix licenses themselves; and AT&T was investing significant capital in Unix research and development that would otherwise have required vendors to hire more of their own expensive engineers.

[During 1982](http://web.archive.org/web/20220603215851/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/24/business/information-technology-the-executive-computer.html) in an anti-competitive move, Microsoft quietly ceased new work on Xenix while [still promoting the system](https://books.google.ca/books?id=yy8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44), thus gradually turning it into [vaporware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware) that continued to gain popularity after Microsoft stopped developing the operating system beyond keeping up-to-date with the latest underlying Unix version and maintaining basic stability. [Then in 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundling_of_Microsoft_Windows#The_%22Windows_tax%22), Microsoft would begin creating their infamous anti-competitive licensing deals with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to eradicate competition in the operating system market by severely penalizing companies that shipped operating systems other than MS-DOS on their computers: pre-loading MS-DOS on any one computer sold by a given computer manufacturer required the OEM paid licensing royalties equal to the number of computers they sold instead of the number of computers with MS-DOS they sold. These selfish deals gave Microsoft undue power over computer manufacturers by making it uneconomical for them to pre-load any operating system but MS-DOS on their systems and thus also granted Microsoft an unfair but unique advantage over other companies that sold competing operating systems at the time. Consequently, these licensing agreements would eventually be ruled as illegal by the United States government. Microsoft was able to leverage this control to drive users and developers to MS-DOS early, thus creating a vicious cycle whereby users could only buy MS-DOS computers preloaded with MS-DOS as the default operating system and developers created applications for MS-DOS because that is where the users were: the self-fulfilling prophecy giving rise to MS-DOS beyond the IBM PC was complete. [MS-DOS 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS#MS-DOS_2.x), released in October 1983, significantly evolved its DOS API and newly written programs that depended on these interfaces would only be compatible with MS-DOS. This vicious cycle would extend to include any product Microsoft bundled with MS-DOS, such as Windows and the Microsoft Office suite. [Much later in 1987](https://news.microsoft.com/1997/11/24/microsoft-applauds-european-commission-decision-to-close-santa-cruz-operation-matter/), Microsoft would lose interest in maintaining Xenix all together in favor of MS-DOS and focusing on their own tightly controlled offerings, selling it to the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO).

[In 1985](https://www.tech-insider.org/personal-computers/research/acrobat/871126.pdf), Microsoft and IBM formed a joint partnership to create a [next generation operating system for personal computers for harnessing capabilities such as protected mode being integrated in new CPU chips](https://web.archive.org/web/20100410013835/http://pages.prodigy.net/michaln/history/pr/87apr_m3592.html) like the Intel 80286 (1982) and Intel 80386 (1985). This operating system, codenamed CP/DOS (not to be confused with CP/M) during its development, was what became OS/2. The name OS/2 was coined by IBM to advertise that this was the next generation operating system to DOS.

[Midway through 1988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DR-DOS), Digital Research launched a competitor to MS-DOS: DR-DOS. DR-DOS was compatible with MS-DOS allowing the Windows graphical environment and other Windows applications to run on it. DR-DOS was ["vastly superior" to MS-DOS](https://www.theregister.com/1999/11/05/drdos_is_terrific_says_ms/) from a technical standpoint. However, DR-DOS, the biggest competitor to MS-DOS, never caught on because Microsoft had already locked in the market well with their anti-competitive bundling practices and licensing deals. Additionally, Microsoft embedded what later became known as the [AARD code](/data/windows/aard-code-market-effects.md) into pre-release Windows 3.1 builds—malicious code that served to sabotage DR-DOS by manipulating stakeholders into believing Windows might not run on DR-DOS when in fact Windows ran better on DR-DOS than it did on MS-DOS.

[In late 1988](https://archive.org/details/showstopperbreak0000zach/page/34/mode/1up), a variety of disagreements on direction surrounding the IBM and Microsoft collaboration led Microsoft to begin creating a new operating system in parallel to working on OS/2. This operating system was initially called New Technology (NT) OS/2 and it was architecturally independent from OS/2, not sharing any code.

[By 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2#1990:_Breakup), the partnership between IBM and Microsoft had entirely broken down, leaving IBM to work on OS/2 by themselves. Unlike MS-DOS which already had applications developed for it at launch due to its compatibility with the CP/M BDOS API, IBM made a new API for OS/2 that had no applications written to it and without applications, OS/2 would be unappealing to consumers. IBM of course knew this so they [convinced many big-name companies to port their applications to OS/2, with IBM using their deep pockets to subsidize the development of at least some of these applications](https://www.os2museum.com/wp/os2-history/os2-2-1-and-2-11/#%20Applications:~:text=IBM%20managed%20to%20convince%20several%20big%2Dname%20companies%20to%20develop%20OS/2%20versions%20of%20their%20products). [Recognizing OS/2 as the last viable contender to Windows in the consumer PC market](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.os.ms-windows.misc/c/-iNeep60eVE/m/Xl5ddAtJENcJ#:~:text=We%20still%20believed%20OS/2%202.0%20could%20be%20made%20a%20success.), Microsoft responded by threatening to deny software makers access to beta versions and information about Windows if they developed for any other platforms. When IBM wanted to distribute OS/2 for preloading onto computers made by external computer manufacturers, they found themselves trapped in a sea of companies who were legally bound by Microsoft's anti-competitive licensing deals not to distribute any operating system with their computers but MS-DOS. [As one IBM executive would later testify](https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/ibm-exec-testifies-of-microsoft-pressure/):

> We were told by Microsoft that we were the only PC manufacturer in the world that hadn't signed a Windows licensing agreement.

So, starting with OS/2 2.0, IBM improvised a workaround to distribute OS/2 with these computer manufacturers by making the Win-OS/2 subsystem: a virtual environment that hosted an MS-DOS system and ran Windows on top while integrating with OS/2. [Thus, computer manufacturers were able to preload OS/2 while still honoring their agreements with Microsoft.](https://www.os2museum.com/wp/os2-history/os2-2-1-and-2-11/#:~:text=With%20OS/2%20for%20Windows%2C%20IBM%20found%20a%20way%20for%20OEMs%20to%20preload%20OS/2%20while%20still%20honoring%20their%20agreements%20with%20Microsoft.) IBM paid a substantial royalty to Microsoft for each copy of MS-DOS and Windows they included in OS/2, [which analysts reckoned to be as much as $20 per copy](https://www.techmonitor.ai/hardware/ibm_goes_a_bundle_on_os2_but_its_not_curtains_for_windows). Due to this high cost that IBM incurred with each OS/2 2.0 sale, for OS/2 2.1 IBM would offer two editions of the operating system: [one "OS/2 Upgrade Edition" with Win-OS/2 included and one "OS/2 for Windows" without Win-OS/2](https://www.blondeguy.com/OS2versions.jpg) that could utilize an existing Windows installation. Even a sale of the OS/2 edition without any of Microsoft's code though would still entitle Microsoft to their ["designated systems" royalty](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/368660.stm#:~:text=designated%20systems). Unfortunately, IBM's workaround would only further bolster Microsoft's dominance in the operating system market because [developers could now program for Microsoft's MS-DOS API or Windows API to effectively both target OS/2 and Windows operating systems](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.os.ms-windows.misc/c/-iNeep60eVE/m/Xl5ddAtJENcJ#:~:text=Why%20write%20for%20OS/2%20and%20sell%20into%20a%20world%20of%205%25%20of%20machines%2C%20when%0Ayou%20can%20write%20for%20the%20Windows%20API%20and%20sell%20to%20*all*%20of%20them%2C%20OS/2%20included!). The market failure and fade to obscurity that OS/2 experienced though would not be due to the contents of the operating system itself: it was a remarkable system with a [clean API](https://www.os2museum.com/wp/os2-history/os2-1-0/#:~:text=OS/2%20provided%20a%20rich%20set%20of%20clearly%20defined%20and%20delineated%20APIs), superior stability and performance to any version of Windows, and had an appealing graphical user interface. IBM's engineering culture was exceptionally strong, in large part because many of the developers who worked on OS/2 carried forward the values of their mainframe background—an environment where every line of code was crafted with care and precision, and efficiency was regarded as a fundamental principle.

[Following the breakout commercial success of Windows 3.1 in 1992, Microsoft renamed NT OS/2 to Windows NT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K3eMzF6x28&t=454s), what we know today as just "Windows", bringing the new operating system to market in July 1993 with the release of Windows NT 3.1. However, the sluggish performance of Windows NT even on computers that exceeded Microsoft's high recommended minimum system requirements meant home users were still running DOS-based Windows for many years. For context, [OS/2 benchmarked about two times faster than NT at running 16-bit Windows applications](https://books.google.ca/books?id=qjsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA100) and its minimum system requirements [were about on par to the requirements for running a performant Unix SVR4 and X GUI pair](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/clone-unix-guide.txt#:~:text=II.%20GENERAL%20CONSIDERATIONS) during the same time period. Microsoft would also carry over their anti-competitive licensing deals from MS-DOS to Windows NT until the practice was struck down in the 2001 [United States v. Microsoft Corp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.) case. For Microsoft, however, the rewards from their unscrupulous tactics—undermining fair, merit-based competition for their own gain and securing control of the PC market—had already far outweighed any penalties they would face.
