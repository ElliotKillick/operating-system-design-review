# AARD Code Market Effects

## Setup

MS-DOS was an operating system that ran on IBM-compatible computers using [IBM's proprietary BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS#History), and conformed to the [DOS API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_API) that was born with 86-DOS with is specification being functionally compatible with CP/M in its first release. Atop MS-DOS was Microsoft's GUI layer known as Windows (the `WIN.COM` program, it was a standalone program back then). DR-DOS was also an operating system that ran on IBM-compatible computers and was compatible with the DOS API. DR-DOS served as a drop-in replacement for MS-DOS and could run Windows without issues.

Digital Research had previously developed their own GUI called the Graphics Environment Manager (GEM), but it had fallen out of relevance by the time Windows 3.0 launched. GEM had once competed with early versions of Windows, but a [lawsuit from Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litigation_involving_Apple_Inc.#GEM_%22look_and_feel%22_suit) forced Digital Research to remove key GUI features like overlapping windows, which dramatically limited GEM's appeal. [Apple also sued Microsoft for Windows copying the look and feel of the Macintosh GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microsoft_Corp), but unlike Digital Research, which [settled out of court due to being unable to afford a prolonged legal battle in 1985](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/01/business/digital-research-to-modify-gem.html), Microsoft quickly prevailed, as by 1994 the courts had by then solidified their stance on what aspects of a GUI could be protected by copyright.

## The Problem

[DR-DOS was a superior product to MS-DOS in every way](https://www.theregister.com/1999/11/05/drdos_is_terrific_says_ms/): lower memory usage, more advanced command-line shell, task switching, disk compression, smaller on disk, more modular, an open design philosophy, FAT32 support, and lots more. DR-DOS was also cheaper than MS-DOS and did not come with restrictive licensing deals. A huge problem for Microsoft. Due to DR-DOS being the superior platform, some people were buying Windows and then installing it onto DR-DOS. Microsoft did not like this and found the possibility of it becoming a trend concerning.

## Microsoft's Solution

Microsoft was operating too expediently to consider improving MS-DOS and they certainly were not about to let a free market competition based on merit pursue. Trying to ban running Windows on platforms that were not MS-DOS through the EULA would only trigger antitrust scrutiny. So, Microsoft resorted to technical sabotage, giving birth to the AARD code [in December 1991](https://web.archive.org/web/20051210072152/http://www.ddj.com/documents/s%3D1030/ddj9309d/9309d.htm#:~:text=The%20message%20appears%20with%20the%20release%20labeled%20%22final%20beta%20release%20(build%2061)%22%20(dated%20December%2020%2C%201991)), shortly after Novell acquired Digital Research in June 1991. This code was designed to detect whether Windows was running on MS-DOS or another DOS variant like DR-DOS. If DR-DOS was detected, the installer would display a cryptic error or warning message, suggesting that the system was unsupported or unstable. The goal was to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt. The code was XOR-encrypted, self-modifying, obfuscated, and even equipped with anti-debugging measures in an attempt to conceal its presence. The AARD code stayed active in the widely distributed beta builds of Windows 3.1 that Microsoft gave out and it likely would have stayed longer if not discovered by reverse engineer Geoff Chappell. These beta builds were used by OEMs, reviewers, developers, and some early adopters meaning its effects reached influential stakeholders before the final release of Windows 3.1. The malicious code was successful in its job of steering people away from non-Microsoft DOS variants, undermining Novell's emerging product ecosystem and merit-based competition (remember, competition is always good for consumers).
