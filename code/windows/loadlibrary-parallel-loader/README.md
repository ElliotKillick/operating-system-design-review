# `LoadLibrary` Parallel Loader Experiment

Running two library loads concurrently to study the loader's ability for work parallelization. In particular, this experiment seeks to find out whether one `LoadLibrary` can perform module initialization at the same time as a concurrent `LoadLibrary` performs module mapping and snapping.
